# PredictingMissingLinks

Repository for code for 'Finding missing links in interaction networks' (Terry and Lewis 2020), forthcoming in *Ecology*.

Notes:

`CodeForMissingLinks.rmd` is a long document that details all code used to run the analyses. It is knitted with the outputs in the corresponding `.html` file. Note that there has been only a limited amount of formatting, so it is quite ugly. 

Results and outputs are saved into and read from the `Outputs/` folder. Note that the numbering does not line up totally with the final paper after some revisions. 

The core part of the code (i.e. predicting the missing links) relies on the cassandRa R package, which is hosted on CRAN and maintained seperately at https://github.com/jcdterry/cassandRa
