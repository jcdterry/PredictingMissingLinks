Frank K, Krell FT, Walter P, Slade EM, Raine EH, Chiew LY, Vairappan CS, Schmitt T, Blüthgen N (2018) Global dung webs: high trophic generalism of dung beetles along the latitudinal diversity gradient. Ecology Letters, in press. 

'ELEblüthgenST1.xlsx' is given as an additional overview for the stored datasets, it is the same file as published with the original manuscript and contains processed data and additional information for all used datasets (i.e. dung beetle - resource interaction networks). The published data sources are also listed in the ’References.txt' file.

The folder 'raw data' contains txt-files which represent the raw data we used for any kind of calculation and figures in the manuscript.
Names of the txt-files state the author of the original manuscript and the year of publication/sampling. An additional term allows to distinguish between multiple datasets within the same publication e.g. 'Correa_2016_brazilian_savanna'.
